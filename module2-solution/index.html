          Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players
          each who score runs (points). This is done by hitting the ball across
          the boundary, or by running between two sets of three small, wooden
          posts called wickets. The wickets are at each end of a rectangle of
          short grass called 'the pitch'. The pitch is inside a much larger oval
          of grass called the 'area of play'. The area of play is a 30 yard
          circle inside.
