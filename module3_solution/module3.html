            The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated
            fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). Chickens
            are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a
            total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018. up from more than 19
            billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other
            bird or domesticated fowl.Humans keep chickens primarily as a source
            of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as
            pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
            chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
            (4th–2nd centuries BC). Genetic studies have pointed to multiple
            maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but
            with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India,
            the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and
            to Greece by the 5th century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since
            the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
            having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar,
            Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.<br>

            The word meat comes from the Old English word mete, which referred
            to food in general. The term is related to mad in Danish, mat in
            Swedish and Norwegian, and matur in Icelandic and Faroese, which
            also mean 'food'. The word mete also exists in Old Frisian (and to a
            lesser extent, modern West Frisian) to denote important food,
            differentiating it from swiets (sweets) and dierfied (animal feed).
            Most often, meat refers to skeletal muscle and associated fat and
            other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as
            offal. Meat is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense to
            mean the flesh of mammalian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.)
            raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of fish,
            other seafood, insects, poultry, or other animals.In the context of
            food, meat can also refer to "the edible part of something as
            distinguished from its covering (such as a husk or shell)", for
            example, coconut meat. In English, there are also specialized terms
            for the meat of particular animals. These terms originated with the
            Norman conquest of England in 1066: while the animals retained their
            English names, their meat as brought to the tables of the invaders
            was referred to them with the Norman French words for the respective
            animal. In time, these appellations came to be used by the entire
            population.<br>

            Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi ,
             stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of 
             the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before
             consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source 
             of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means 
             "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 
             sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be 
             sour";the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists
              as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.
              Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
              Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period
               (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to
              increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's
               longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually
              abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several 
              centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice 
              were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.<br>
